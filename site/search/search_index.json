The solution? Any card can serve as land/energy. How does it work? You draw six cards, then put the next two cards face down in a pile. That\u2019s your gauge. Some monsters and spells cost gauge. If a monster says, \"pay 1 gauge,\" you just take a card from the gauge and move it to your dropzone, graveyard, or discard pile.</p> <p>How do you get gauge? Every turn you draw, and optionally, you can charge and draw\u2014putting a card from your hand into the pile while drawing a new card. It's that simple. There are cards that help you get gauge, but for the most part, everyone has gauge. With a house rule variation (draw 8 cards, then pick 2 to put into the gauge), it adds another layer of gameplay. I love it\u2014it's like gambling every turn. You get a lot of card advantage, and it means all 50 cards are useful in some capacity.</p> <p>Throwing a card into the gauge is essentially discarding it, so you have to pick wisely. The big monster might not be useful now, but it could be in a few turns\u2014do I keep it or throw it away? Do I spend all of my 4 gauge on this one play, risking starting over from 0 gauge if it fails?</p> <p>Now you might think, \"What\u2019s stopping me from filling my board with expensive gauge creatures?\" Eventually, I would just get an edge since gauge comes back at a more or less fixed rate. Buddy Fight \"fixed\" this (details below) by introducing monster sizes: 0, 1, 2, &amp; 3. You have three monster slots, and the max size allowed is 3. Obviously, the bigger the monster, the stronger it is, so balance was maintained. Placing a monster in the center meant you couldn't attack, but you couldn't get hit either. It feels constrictive, but honestly, it works to its advantage\u2014you have to be creative within the constraints. It also ensured that one player couldn't run away with the game.

In Pok\u00e9mon, you need dice with counters to keep track of health, which gets out of control, especially if you have multiple injured Pok\u00e9mon. Here, it's a simple number: if the number is too high, the monster dies. All the monsters are basically glass cannons. The game didn\u2019t need tokens for extra monsters or for tracking damage.

The first time you play it, you gain 1 life. That\u2019s it. For a game called Buddy Fight, there was no real advantage to choosing your favorite card as a buddy. It boiled down to picking the cheapest, smallest size card you have four copies of to get the 1 life bonus as soon as possible, and then the buddy goes back to being nothing.

They tried to fix it by adding shields, but that kind of ruined the whole point of an impact.
