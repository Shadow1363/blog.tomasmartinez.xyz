# Welcome!

I'm Tom√°s Martinez and this is my blog/docs!

Using Material for MK Docs, I write Markdown (.md) and it automatically creates a site for me.

Huge shoutout to https://www.youtube.com/@james-willett, followed along to his videos to get the site started.
If you also want to take a peek under the hood, this site is on [github](https://github.com/shadow1363/blog.tomasmartinez.xyz)!

## Purpose

Ah yes, the purpose of this site. Well it comes down to three:

1. Make a habit of writing
2. Talk Tech
3. Documentation for my API's

A blog is just cool too, it's like my own social media site, just for me and I can do whatever I want.
But I guess the real reason is I want to leave an impact in life. I want to create something, not just be a consumer.

Unfortunately, it will all be in english. I tried setting up a trilingual site but it would be too much work, having to rewrite all my thoughts 3 times.

Anyways if you're here you probably want to check out out my blog or documentation.
On the left side bar, there should be **API Docs** and **Blog**.
