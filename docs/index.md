# Welcome!

I'm Tom√°s Martinez and this is my blog/docs!

Using Material for MkDocs, I write Markdown (.md) and it automatically creates a site for me.

Huge shoutout to [James Willet](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw_jGKXm9lIaJCD8YClu6cAz1TcFdJdIf) - I followed along with his videos to get the site started.

If you also want to take a peek under the hood, this site is on [GitHub](https://github.com/shadow1363/blog.tomasmartinez.xyz)!

## Purpose

Ah yes, the purpose of this site. Well, it comes down to three things:

1. Make a habit of writing
2. Talk Tech
3. Documentation for my APIs

A blog is just cool too, it's like my own social media site, just for me, and I can do whatever I want.

But I guess the real reason is I want to leave an impact in life. I want to create something, not just be a consumer. And hey, if I just so happen to solve a very niche problem that someone later down the line uses, i'd consider this site a success.

Unfortunately, it will all *mostly* be in English. I tried setting up a trilingual site, but it would be too much work having to rewrite all my thoughts 3 times.

Anyways, if you're here, you probably want to check out my blog or documentation.

On the left sidebar, you should find **Docs** and **Blog**.
