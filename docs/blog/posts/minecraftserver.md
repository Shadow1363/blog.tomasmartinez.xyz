# Old Laptop to cross-platform Minecraft Server

Turning broken laptop into a Java/Bedrock Minecraft using PaperMC & Geyser

<!-- more -->

My goal with this guide is to be as simple to follow so everyone can reduce their tech waste.

Here's the laptop, my good friend Bumblebee, he was a used laptop I picked up around ~2020 in Singapore. Top of the line laptop, well at least for 2014 standards.

- RTX 860M
- 32 GB of Memory
- i7 7th Gen

As the years dragged on so did Bumblebee, camera stop working, disk stop working (not like I used it), and finally the hinge broke off and he was out for the count. BUT today i'm going to give him one last job, until he finally blows up.

## What we will be doing

1. Linux (Maximum performance)
2. PaperMC (Easiest install for max performance)
3. Configuring (Allow external connections, port forwarding, etc)
4. GeyserMC (Allows Bedrock players to join Java)

## Installing Linux

## PaperMC

## Configuring

## GeyserMC
